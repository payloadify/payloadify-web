            Pentesting and bug bounty work are full of tasks that are simple
            in theory and a pain in practice: remembering the right hashcat
            mode and flags, assembling a reverse shell one-liner without
            breaking the quoting, decoding a JWT to check if it's signed with{" "}
            <code>alg: none</code>. None of it is hard. All of it is easy to
            get slightly wrong, and today it gets pieced together from cheat
            sheets, slow or cluttered sites, or memory.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scoring CVSS is the same problem: every finding needs a score,
            and searching for a score you already used in a previous report
            is a hassle. That's why the CVSS calculator lets you save a
            finding's scoring and click to reload it next time. That
            friction, everywhere and not just CVSS, is the reason Payloadify
            exists.
          </p>
          <p>
            The goal is to collapse that multi-step, syntax-heavy work
            into one clean, fast, click-driven flow: pick options, copy the
            result. It's for people who wants a quick, reliable, and private tool to get the job done.

            Prioritizing speed
          </h2>
          <p>
            Payloadify is designed to be fast. In every development decision, user experience is always kept in mind e.g. if feature X would slow down the site or make it harder to use, it is not implemented. Catchy animations and flashy graphics are avoided in favor of a clean, fast, and efficient interface.
