/**
 * The full OWASP Top 10 (2021), API Security Top 10 (2023), and Mobile Top 10 (2024) catalogues
 * — all 10 entries in each of the three lists, not just the subset templates.ts/chaining.ts
 * happen to reference today. Every entry (including the 13 added in the completeness pass) was
 * verified directly against owasp.org during authoring — see the research notes below for
 * cross-cutting caveats. Keeping the full catalogue here (rather than only "used" categories)
 * means a future template can pick up e.g. A06/A09/API4/API9/M1/M7 without a second research pass.
 *
 * - XSS, SQL Injection, and OS Command Injection all collapsed into the single "A03:2021 –
 *   Injection" category in the 2021 revision (previously separate/more granular).
 * - CSRF and Path Traversal have no standalone OWASP Top 10 category at all — both are just
 *   CWEs bucketed under A01:2021 on OWASP's own mapped-CWE list, not distinct entries.
 * - Platform drives which family is shown: a template's owaspRefId should point at the most
 *   specific catalogue that actually covers its platform — Web Top 10 for web findings, API
 *   Security Top 10 for API findings, Mobile Top 10 for findings that are genuinely mobile-app-
 *   specific (client-side storage, WebView/binary issues, on-device auth). A vulnerability found
 *   via a mobile app but that actually lives in its backend API (e.g. missing rate-limiting on
 *   the login endpoint) should still cite the API category, not a Mobile one — the platform the
 *   bug was *found on* isn't always the platform the fix belongs to.
 * - Where a vuln type has a confirmed *exact* API Top 10 2023 analogue (BOLA, Broken
 *   Authentication, BOPLA, Broken Function Level Authorization, SSRF, Security
 *   Misconfiguration), that more specific category is used instead of the general web one.
 *   Some families (SQLi, XSS, OS command injection, XXE, insecure deserialization, path
 *   traversal, open redirect) have no API-specific analogue at all — the 2023 API Top 10
 *   dropped its 2019 "Injection" category on the assumption the main OWASP Top 10 already
 *   covers it — so those keep the Web category even when the platform is "api".
 * - API10:2023's own URL slug is irregular — "0xaa-unsafe-consumption-of-apis", not the
 *   "0xa10-..." pattern the other nine entries follow. Verified live; not a typo.
 * - Mobile M7's official page title is singular — "Insufficient Binary Protection" — even
 *   though it's commonly written "Protections" elsewhere; the label here matches the page title.

 * (see CvssCalculatorTool's owaspWebVersion state). Keyed by CWE rather than by the old

 * be *wrong* for several CWEs that OWASP moved to a different category than their old peers
 * when the taxonomy was reshuffled, per each 2025 category's own published CWE list:
 *
 * - CWE-200 (sensitive data exposed in a URL) sat under A02:2021 Cryptographic Failures, but
 *   2025's Cryptographic Failures list does NOT include it — OWASP moved it to A01:2025
 *   Broken Access Control instead (that page's own background text calls out CWE-200 by name).
 * - CWE-1392 (default credentials) and CWE-209 (verbose error messages) both sat under
 *   A05:2021 Security Misconfiguration; 2025's Security Misconfiguration list contains
 *   neither. CWE-1392 moved to A07:2025 Authentication Failures; CWE-209 moved to the new
 *   A10:2025 Mishandling of Exceptional Conditions.
 * - CWE-918 (SSRF) sat alone under A10:2021; that category no longer exists in 2025 — SSRF
 *   was folded into A01:2025 Broken Access Control (confirmed via that page's background text).
 *
 * Every other CWE below the same 2021 category are a straight rename/renumber (verified by
 * checking each CWE's presence in the corresponding 2025 category's own published CWE list,
 * not assumed from the rank shift). This table only needs an entry for CWEs that are actually
 * used with a "web-"-family owaspRefId in templates.ts/chaining.ts today — owasp.test.ts and
 * templates.test.ts assert every such CWE has one, so a future template introducing a new CWE
 * will fail loudly here instead of silently mis-mapping.
