/**
 * Every unique unordered pair of the 14 VulnType families (vulnTypes.ts) — C(14,2) = 91
 * entries, one per pair, per the confirmed "fully hand-authored matrix" scope decision. No
 * runtime "no override" fallback exists; chaining.test.ts asserts this file has exactly one
 * entry for every pair and fails loudly if a family is added without its new pair entries.
 *
 * Each combined vector was authored by taking the more severe rating per metric between a
 * representative "worst case" template from each of the two families (per-metric severity
 * order: AV N>A>L>P, AC L>H, AT N>P, PR N>L>H, UI3.1 N>R, UI4.0 N>P>A, Scope C>U, all
 * Confidentiality/Integrity/Availability metrics H>L>N), then verified against this project's
 * own CVSS 3.1/4.0 scoring engines. The OWASP/VRT/CWE category shown for each pair is drawn
 * from whichever of the two parent families has the higher standalone CVSS 3.1 base score —
 * a systematic, reviewable rule rather than an invented "merged" category with no basis.
