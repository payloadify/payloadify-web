# Payloadify — Project Brief

## What this is
A security/pentest utility tools hub, similar to iLovePDF but for pentesters.
One card per tool family, one tool per page, SEO-first, free to use. Domain: payloadify.dev

## Target audience
Pentesters, bug bounty hunters, OSCP/CEH students, red teamers.
They arrive via Google search for a specific task, use the tool once, leave.

## Tech stack
- Frontend: Next.js (static export) or plain Vue/React SPA
- Hosting: Cloudflare Pages (free tier)
- Backend (only when unavoidable, e.g. DNS lookups): Cloudflare Workers
- No database, no user accounts, no login for v1
- Keep everything client-side (runs in browser) wherever possible —
  this is a real selling point for a security-conscious audience

## Build order (v1 — build in this order, one at a time)
1. JWT Decoder/Tamper — decode header/payload, flag alg:none and weak signing
2. Hash Identifier — detect hash type + show matching Hashcat mode number
3. Hash Generator — same layout as Identifier, connected via tabs (see below)
4. Payload Encoder/Decoder — chainable Base64, Hex, URL, HTML-entity, Unicode escape
5. Homoglyph Identifier/Generator — see spec below
6. XSS payload generator — an all in one XSS payload generators for pentesters, full specs read below.
7. SQLi payload generator — an all in one SQLi payload that helps pentesters build a SQLi command, full specs read below.
8. Reverse Shell Generator — multi-language one-liners (bash, python, PHP, nc, PowerShell)
9. MSFVenom Generator — an all in one MSFVenom generator that helps pentesters and learners to generate their own MSFVenom command in one click
10. CVSS 3.1/4.0 Calculator — click-through vectors, output vector string. 
(Tools 11-14 — subdomain permutation generator, security headers analyzer, SPF/DKIM/DMARC checker — come later, JWT generator, after v1 validates)

### Tool 7: SQLi Payload generator
- Feature is intended to help pentesters by generating a useful sql injection commands by just a single click.
- Feature has an option to choose what type of SQL used, it should have common used SQL.
- Feature has an option to generate what kind of information to pull with the sql command like hostname, or sql type, tables, or anything, this can be chained by clicking a single "add info" button, and then dropdown appears on what to pull and user can choose custom info that is something that they just input into the field.
- Feature has an evasion option that is most widely used by pentesters to evade WAF or generic defenses, this probably be named as obfuscation.
- Feature has lots of variety of encoding support.
- Feature has an option to check blacklisted characters. IF the obfuscation not support a certain blacklisted characters, the blacklisted characters should be greyed out automatically.
- Feature has a "level" (like XSS payload generator feature).
- Security is a concern for user and website. User shouldn't be able to generate a lot of payload, just one at a time. apply rate limit (like XSS payload generator).

## Deferred features (intentionally out of scope for now)
- Hash Identifier batch mode (paste a whole file of dumped hashes, one per line, get a results table) — v1 only identifies one hash at a time. Batch support is saved as a future monetization-driving feature once site traffic justifies the extra build effort, not part of initial launch.
- XSS payload batch mode (generate a long list of payloads with different or same levels (user choice)) - v1 only generate one at a time.
- SQLi payload batch mode (generate a long list of payloads with different or same levels (user choice)) - v1 only generate one at a time.

## Future ideas (not active build order)
- A dedicated bcrypt tool/page — bcrypt needs a salt + cost-factor input,  which is a different UI shape than the plain "type text, get a hash" Hash Generator. Worth its own page eventually rather than bolting onto Hash Generator. Not scheduled; revisit after the current build order.
- PWA support (manifest + service worker) if analytics show meaningful mobile traffic — do NOT build a native mobile app before this data exists
- Subdomain permutation generator, security headers analyzer,
  SPF/DKIM/DMARC checker (tools 7-9)
- Add JWT generator features that can generate Standard Secret Key (alphanumeric only) and Enhanced Secret Key (With Special Characters), with encryption strength that can be set from 128-512(default to 256).

## Design/UX principles
- One URL per tool (e.g. /jwt-decoder), never a single blank-canvas app
- Fast load, minimal JS, no unnecessary dependencies
- Clean, modern UI — this is competing against dated tools like jwt.io
- Every tool page needs a unique <title> and meta description matching
  how people actually search (e.g. "jwt decoder online")

## Important constraints
- I (the project owner) have a pentesting/security background but am NOT an experienced coder. Explain what you're building in plain terms as you go.
- Since our audience is security-literate, correctness matters a lot —
  flag any assumptions or edge cases you're unsure about rather than
  guessing silently.
- Budget is near-$0. Avoid suggesting paid services/dependencies unless
  there's no free alternative.

## Scope discipline
Do not add features, fields, or behaviors beyond what's explicitly requested. 
If you think an enhancement would help, describe it and ask before building it — don't build it silently as part of an unrelated task.
